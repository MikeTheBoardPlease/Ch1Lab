  <p>I'm working to major in Programming.</p>
  <p>I've developed games in the language Scratch. If you would like to try a game, I've recreated the first Five Night's at Freddy's. https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1071710098/ </p>
  <p>I have been in the desire to program games since I was 10 years old.</p>

  <p>A question I have: If we finish a days worth of work early, are we able to leave early, or in cases, not show up?</p>
